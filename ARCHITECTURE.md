Production Manager App – Architecture Overview & License Statement
==================================================================

Overview:
---------
The Production Manager App is a closed-source Windows `.exe` application designed for offline use,
with secure license enforcement and automated Excel reporting. It does not rely on cloud services
or persistent backend sessions.

Architecture:
-------------
License Enforcement Flow:
    User Launches App → License Prompt → Gumroad API Validation → Local Unlock

    - On first launch, the app prompts for a Gumroad license key.
    - The key is verified via Gumroad’s /v2/licenses/verify endpoint.
    - If valid, the encrypted `.exe` payload is unlocked and the app initializes.
    - License status may be revalidated periodically (e.g. every 7 days).

Local Session Context:
    - All user activity is stored locally in an encrypted SQLite database.
    - No Redis, cloud sync, or external session store is used.
    - Secure login is enforced using salted + hashed admin credentials.

Payroll & Job Entry Workflow:
    Admin Login → Job Entry → Payroll Calculation → Excel Export

    - Admin enters job details, employee info, and material usage.
    - Payroll is calculated using configurable methods:
        • Square footage × rate
        • Bags installed × piece rate
        • Hourly wage
    - Pay is auto-split across employees per job.
    - Excel reports are auto-generated two days after the pay period ends.

File Storage & Export:
    - All data is stored locally under:
        Documents/AIAI_PM_App/Payroll_Excels/YYYY-MM/Payroll_YYYY-MM.xlsx
    - Each employee receives a dedicated worksheet labeled by week.
    - Reports are compatible with Microsoft Excel and grouped by month.
